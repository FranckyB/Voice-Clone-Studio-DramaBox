# Voice Clone Studio — DramaBox Edition

> **This is a stripped-down version of [Voice Clone Studio](https://github.com/FranckyB/Voice-Clone-Studio), rebuilt around [DramaBox](https://github.com/Resemble-AI/DramaBox) as the sole TTS engine.**
>**Meant for Voice Cloning as well as Lora generation for ComfyUI**
>
> For the full-featured version with multiple TTS engines (Qwen3-TTS, VibeVoice, LuxTTS, and more), see the main repo: **https://github.com/FranckyB/Voice-Clone-Studio**

---

> ⚠️ **DramaBox is highly prone to hallucination.** It will frequently add, drop, or mangle words — especially on longer texts. **Expect to generate multiple times** before getting a clean output. Using a seed lets you reproduce good results once you find them.  **It is also limited to around 45 seconds**

---

A modular Gradio app for local voice workflows powered by DramaBox:

- DramaBox for TTS voice cloning and finetuning
- MMAudio for sound effects
- Qwen3-ASR and Whisper for transcription
- llama.cpp or Ollama for prompt generation

## Notes

- The only active TTS engine is DramaBox. The multi-engine support from the main Voice Clone Studio repo (Qwen3-TTS, VibeVoice, LuxTTS) is not included here.
- **DramaBox hallucinates frequently.** Short, simple sentences work best. For longer texts, use "Split Audio by Paragraph" and review each segment.
- For the full-featured version: **https://github.com/FranckyB/Voice-Clone-Studio**
